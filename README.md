# python_tkinter_auto_send_daily_report

this is a small project for send daily report.

due to every day we have to send daily report to other people or boss. 
but we must copy an old word file and change the context.
then create a new email and attach the word file. final to send.

it means wast time to do those actions every day. so i create it.

this is a tkinter GUI application. a window to fill the content of daily report and setting the smtp config.

finish the fill context just click send. every thing is finished.

the application will auto a word file in Daily_report folder. and use smtp to send the attached file.
